# Welcome to MCP Multi-Agent System

**Elevator Pitch**: A hierarchical, multi-agent simulation where specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) collaborate via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to monitor, optimize, and safely control critical physical infrastructure (like power grids, robotics, or satellite networks) autonomously.

This documentation serves all users of the system:
1. **[Core Concepts](core-concepts.md)**: Understand how the layers (Strategic, Coordination, Physical) interact.
2. **[Configuration](configuration.md)**: Environment variables and state storage details.
3. **[Developer Guide](development.md)**: How to create new MCP sensor servers or physical domain adapters.
4. **[API Reference](api.md)**: Autogenerated Python API documentation.
